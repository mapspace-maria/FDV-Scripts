# FDV-Scripts

EXERCISE 01

I'VE CREATED A NEW SCRIPT FOR THE ELEMENTS ON THE SCENE
I FOCUSED ON THE CUBE ACTOR - ADD THE SCRIPT AS COMPONENT TO IT
ADD THE CONTROLLER TO THE Y AXIS
ALSO I ADDED CONTROLLER TO BE ABLE TO MOVE IT ON THE X AXIS 

EXERCISE 02 

I'VE PLAYED WITh THE VALUES X,Y,Z IN A DUPLICATED ACTOR
OBSERVED THE ELEMENTS AND THEIR BEHAVIOR ACCORDING TO THE SCRIPT
ALTHO THYE'VE SAME CONTROLLER BEHAVIOR HAS CHANGED DUE TO THE CONTECT AROUND IS DIFFFERENT
    STARTING POSITION, ADDITIONAL ACTORS LIKE SPHERES
    
EXERCISE 03

I'VE ADDED NEW LINE OF CODE TO DEFINE THE VECTOR 3 DIRECTION
SO I ENSURE THE SHPARE CHASE THE CUBE NOW

EXERCISE 04

I'VE ADDED THE SPEED AND ACCURACY BY DECLARING THE VALUES.
THEN, I INCLUDE IT IN THE METHOD START TO MAKE IT WORK

EXERCISE 05

I'VE ADDED THE LOOKAT SO THE DIRECTION AND MOVEMENT OF CUBE AND SPHERE WORKS CORRECTLY.
NOW, THE SPHERE TURN AND LOOK AT THE CUBE BEFORE START CHASING IT

EXERCISE 06

THEN, TIME TO DEBUG, SO I'VE ADDED A RED RAY TO VERIFY IF THE TRAYECTORY IS CORRECTLY PLACED.
CUBE SHOULD MOVE ACCORDINGLY TO THAT TRAYECTORY - THEN, I COULD REMOVE THE RED RAY.

EXERCISE 07

I'VE CREATE AN SCRIPT FOR THE PLAYER USING ALL THE CODE I'VE WRITTEN IN THE PREVIOUS EXERCISES.
THE PLAYER MOVE IN X,Z USING THE ARROWS AND AWSD

THEN, I'VE CREATE AN SCRIPT FOR THE ENEMY, WHO WILL NEED TO CHASE THE PLAYER. 
SAME AS BEFORE, USING THE PART OF THE CODE I'VE CREATE AT PREVIOUS EXERCISES.
   

EXERCISE 08

I'VE TRIED THE DIFFERENT BULLET POINT OF THE EXERCISE AND THIA ARE THE REFLECTIONS
    1.NONE OF THE OBJECTS FOLLOW THE GARAVITY PRINCIPALS - HENCE THEY REMAIN FLOATING (INITIAL POSITIONS)
    2.THE SPHERES FALL DOWN TO THE GROUND WHILE THE CUBE REMAINS FLOATING - I CAN CONTROL THE CUBE 
    3. ALL ACTORS HAS SAME GRAVITY PRINCIPALS SO THEY GET ATTRACTED BY THE GROUND
    4. SAME AS PREVIOUS HOWEVER, YOU NOTICIE ONE OF THE MASS IS HIGHER - HENCE THE BEHAVIOR HAS CHANGED
    5.THE ACTOR BEHAVE HAS EXPECTED. THE CUBE REACT ACCORDING TO THE ISTRIGGER
    6. AGAIN YOU SEE A CHANGE ON THE CUBE DUE TO THE ISTRIGGER + KINETIC
    7. ONCE AGAIN, THE BAHAVIOR IS ACCORDING TO THE NEW CHANGES MADE TO THE ACTOR
    8. THE ACTOR WITHOUT ROTATION DOES NOT ROTATE - THE REST REMAIN AS BEFORE 
    
EXERCISE 09

I'VE CREATED NEW SCRIPT TO CONTROLLER THE ROTATION, SPEED AND MOVEMENT ON THE PLAYER.
ADDING KEYCODE.SPACE FOR SPEED, KEYCODE.A/D FOR THE ROTATION AND KEEPING THE ARROW FOR THE LATERAL MOVEMENTS

EXERCISE10

I'VE ADDED 3 MORE SCRIPTS TO COMPLETE THIS GAME. 
FIRST ONE IT'S TO ADJUST THE SPEED. THIS TIME THEIR IS SOME BUTTON ON THE SCREEN FOR THE PLAYER TO GET TURBO SPEED IF IT'S NEEDED
SECOND ONE, IT'S TO ADD SCORING PANEL TO THE SCREEN WHERE IT SHOW THE POINST WHILE YOU'RE PLAYING
THIRD ONE, IT'S THE PILLS THE PLAYER SHOULD EAT TO OBTAIN POINTS - EACH PILL IS 10 POINTS. PILLS WILL DESAPPEAR WHEN THE PLAYER COLLISION WITH IT USING THE DESTROY FUNCTION
